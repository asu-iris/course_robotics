A robot manipulator is mechanically constructed by

-   a set of rigid bodies, each body called a **link**,

-   **joints**, connecting two consecutive links and providing motion
    constraints (degrees of freedom)

-   **actuators**, such as electric/hydraulic/pneumatic actuators,
    deliver forces or torques that cause the robot's links to move,

-   **an end effector**, such as a gripper or hand, is attached to a
    specific link for specific tasks.

The fundamental structure of a manipulator is the serial or open
kinematic chain. From a topological viewpoint, a kinematic chain is
termed open when there is only one sequence of links connecting the two
ends of the chain. Alternatively, a manipulator contains a closed
kinematic chain when a sequence of links forms a loop.

# Configuration

```{important}
The **configuration** of a robot is a complete specification of the
position of every point of the robot. Since the robot's links are rigid
and of a known shape, only a few variables (coordinates in a general
sense) can be selected to represent its configuration.
```



For example, in the following figure, the configuration of a door can be
represented by a single variable, the hinge angle $\theta$. The
configuration of a point on a plane can be described by two coordinates,
$(x, y)$. The configuration of a coin lying heads up on a flat table can
be described by three coordinates: two coordinates $(x, y)$ that specify
the location of a particular point on the coin, and one coordinate
$(\theta)$ that specifies the coin's orientation.

(a) The configuration of a door is described by the angle $\theta$.
(b) The configuration of a point in a plane is described by coordinates
$(x, y)$. (c) The configuration of a coin (heads up) on a table is
described by $(x, y, \theta)$, where $\theta$ defines the direction in
which Abraham Lincoln is looking.
```


:::{important}
The minimum number $n$ of real-valued coordinates needed to represent
the configuration is the number of **degrees of freedom (dof)** of the
robot. The $n$-dimensional space containing all possible configurations
of the robot is called the **configuration space (C-space)**. The
configuration of a robot is represented by a point in its C-space.

# Degrees of Freedom

## General Rule

We have the following general rule for determining the number of degrees
of freedom of a system:

::: {important}
degrees of freedom =  number of variables - number of independent equations (constraints)
:::

Degrees of freedom of a coin in 3D
space
```





Example: consider a coin in 3D space in Fig.
[8](#c1.fig.3dcoin){reference-type="ref" reference="c1.fig.3dcoin"}, the
coordinates for the three points $A, B$, and $C$ are given by
$\left(x_{A}, y_{A}, z_{A}\right),\left(x_{B}, y_{B}, z_{B}\right)$, and
$\left(x_{C}, y_{C}, z_{C}\right)$, respectively. Point $A$ can be
placed freely (three degrees of freedom). The location of point $B$ is
subject to the constraint $d(A, B)=d_{A B}$, meaning it must lie on the
sphere of radius $d_{A B}$ centered at $A$. Thus we have $3-1=2$
freedoms to specify, which can be expressed as the latitude and
longitude for the point on the sphere. Finally, the location of point
$C$ must lie at the intersection of spheres centered at $A$ and $B$ of
radius $d_{A C}$ and $d_{B C}$, respectively. In the general case the
intersection of two spheres is a circle, and the location of point $C$
can be described by an angle that parametrizes this circle. Point $C$
therefore adds $3-2=1$ freedom. Once the position of point $C$ is
chosen, the coin is fixed in space. In summary, a rigid body in
three-dimensional space has six freedoms, which can be described by the
three coordinates parametrizing point $A$, the two angles parametrizing
point $B$, and one angle parametrizing point $C$, provided $A, B$, and
$C$ are noncollinear.

-   A rigid body moving in 3-dimensional space, which we call a spatial
    rigid body, has 6 degrees of freedom.

-   A rigid body moving in a 2-dimensional plane, which we call a planar
    rigid body, has 3 degrees of freedom.

## DOF for Different Joints

In typical robots, a joint can be viewed as providing freedoms
to allow one rigid body to move relative to another. It can also be
viewed as providing constraints on the possible motions of the two rigid
bodies it connects. The following table summarizes the freedoms and
constraints provided by the various joint types.

 | Joint type |          dof $f$  |    Constraint counts between two spatial bodies|
 | :----: |  :----: |    :----:  | 
  |      Revolute (R)   |   1       |          5| 
   |    Prismatic (P)  |    1      |  2      |      5| 
   |      Helical (H)    |  1   |       5
   |  Cylindrical (C)   |   2     |        4| 
   |    Universal (U)    |  2     |    4| 
   |    Spherical (S)   |   3     |       3| 

## Gr端bler's Formula

Since our robots consist of rigid bodies, the degree of freedom of a
robot can be expressed as follows:

:::{important}
degrees of freedom =  number of variables - number of independent equations (constraints)
:::

:::{note}
Consider a mechanism consisting of $N$ links, where the ground is also
regarded as a link. Let $J$ be the number of joints, $m$ be the number
of degrees of freedom of a rigid body $(m=3$ for planar mechanisms and
$m=6$ for spatial mechanisms), $f_{i}$ be the number of freedoms
provided by joint $i$, and $c_{i}$ be the number of constraints provided
by joint $i$, where $f_{i}+c_{i}=m$ for all $i$. Then the Gr端bler's
formula for degrees of freedom of the robot is

$$\begin{aligned}
\operatorname{dof} & =\underbrace{m(N-1)}_{\text {rigid body freedoms }}-\underbrace{\sum_{i=1}^{J} c_{i}}_{\text {joint constraints }} \\
& =m(N-1)-\sum_{i=1}^{J}\left(m-f_{i}\right) \\
& =m(N-1-J)+\sum_{i=1}^{J} f_{i} .
\end{aligned}$$
:::

This formula holds only if all joint constraints are independent. If
they are not independent then the formula provides a lower bound on the
number of degrees of freedom. Below are some examples of using Grubler's
Formula to find the DoFs of different machenisms.

$\operatorname{dof}=3((k+1)-1-k)+k=k$.\

A planar mechanism with two overlapping
joints.
```

The planar mechanism illustrated has three links that meet at a single
point on the right of the large link. Recalling that a joint by
definition connects exactly two links, the joint at this point of
intersection should not be regarded as a single revolute joint. Rather,
it is correctly interpreted as two revolute joints overlapping each
other. The mechanism consists of eight links $(N=8)$, eight revolute
joints, and one prismatic joint. The Gr端bler's formula:

$$\operatorname{dof}=3(8-1-9)+9(1)=3$$

Stewart-Gough
platform
```

The Stewart-Gough platform consists of two platforms - the lower one
stationary and regarded as ground, the upper one mobile - connected by
six universal-prismatic-spherical (UPS) legs. The total number of links
is $14(N=14)$. There are six universal joints (each with two degrees of
freedom, $f_{i}=2$ ), six prismatic joints (each with a single degree of
freedom, $f_{i}=1$ ), and six spherical joints (each with three degrees
of freedom, $f_{i}=3$ ). The total number of joints is 18 . Substituting
these values into Gr端bler's formula with $m=6$ yields

$$\operatorname{dof}=6(14-1-18)+6(1)+6(2)+6(3)=6 .$$

# Configuration Space 

Consider a point moving on the surface of a sphere. The C-space is
2-dimensional, as the configuration can be described by two coordinates:
latitude and longitude. As another example, a point moving on a plane
also has a two-dimensional C-space, with coordinates $(x, y)$. While
both a plane and the surface of a sphere are 2-dimensional, they do not
have the same shape. Unlike the plane, a larger sphere has the same
shape as the original sphere, in that it wraps around in the same way.
Only its size is different. For that matter, an oval-shaped American
football also wraps around similarly to a sphere. The idea that the
2-dimensional surfaces of a small sphere, a large sphere, and a football
all have the same kind of shape, which is different from the shape of a
plane, is expressed by the topology of the surfaces. Two spaces are
topologically equivalent if one can be continuously deformed into the
other without cutting or gluing. A sphere can be deformed into a
football simply by stretching, without cutting or gluing, so those two
spaces are topologically equivalent. You cannot turn a sphere into a
plane without cutting it, however, so a sphere and a plane are not
topologically equivalent.

Three topologically different two-dimensional C-spaces and coordinate
representations. In the latitude-longitude representation of the sphere,
the latitudes $-90^{\circ}$ and $90^{\circ}$ each correspond to a single
point (the South Pole and the North Pole, respectively), and the
longitude parameter wraps around at $180^{\circ}$ and $-180^{\circ}$;
the edges with the arrows are glued together. Similarly, the coordinate
representations of the torus wrap around at the edges marked with
corresponding
arrows.
```

There are two coordinate parameterizations/representations for a
topology space.

-   **explicit parametrization:** A choice of $n$ coordinates, or
    parameters, to represent an $n$-dimensional space is called an
    explicit parametrization of the space. Such an explicit
    parametrization is valid for a particular range of the parameters
    (e.g., $\left[-90^{\circ}, 90^{\circ}\right]$ for latitude and
    $\left[-180^{\circ}, 180^{\circ}\right.$ ) for longitude for a
    sphere, where, on Earth, negative values correspond to \"south\" and
    \"west,\" respectively).

-   **implicit parametrization:** An implicit representation views the
    $n$-dimensional space as embedded in a Euclidean space of more than
    $n$ dimensions, just as a two-dimensional unit sphere can be viewed
    as a surface embedded in a three-dimensional Euclidean space. An
    implicit representation uses the coordinates of the
    higher-dimensional space (e.g., $(x, y, z)$ in the three-dimensional
    space), but subjects these coordinates to constraints that reduce
    the number of degrees of freedom (e.g., $x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}=1$ for
    the unit sphere).

# Workspace of Manipulators

The workspace is the portion of the environment the manipulator's
end-effector can access. Its shape and volume depend on the manipulator
structure as well as on the presence of mechanical joint limits. Note
that the workspace is independent of the task. In the following, we will
show the workspace of different most common manipulators.

Cartesian manipulator includes three prismatic joints whose axes
typically are mutually orthogonal.

Cylindrical manipulator differs from Cartesian in that the first
prismatic joint is replaced with a revolute joint.

joint is replaced with a revolute joint.

A special manipulator is SCARA manipulator that can be realized by
disposing two revolute joints and one prismatic joint in such a way that
all the axes of motion are parallel.

Anthropomorphic manipulator is realized by three revolute joints; the
revolute axis of the first joint is orthogonal to the axes of the other
two which are parallel.
